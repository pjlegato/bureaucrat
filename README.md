# bureaucrat
## An MQ-based API Router for Clojure

Bureaucrat is a Clojure utility library for constructing message queue based
APIs. It provides an abstraction over communications with specific MQs,
and a small router that dispatches incoming API messages to designated
Clojure functions. Reply messages may optionally be generated and sent back
to the caller.
