# bureaucrat
## An MQ-based API Router for Clojure

Bureaucrat is a Clojure utility library for constructing message queue
based APIs. It provides an abstraction over MQ-based communications,
implementations for various backend MQs, and a small router that
dispatches incoming API messages to designated Clojure functions.

### Why the name "bureaucrat"?
The library merely shuttles messages around between endpoints, which
actually perform the useful work.

## Overview
The main abstraction is `bureaucrat.endpoint/IQueueEndpoint`. It
defines a minimal set of abstractions that all queue backends must
implement.

An implementation is provided in `bureaucrat.endpoints.hornetq` that
uses the [Immutant application container's](http://immutant.org/)
built-in message queue, [HornetQ](http://www.jboss.org/hornetq). (It
currently does not support standalone HornetQ, only the embedded
version supplied by Immutant.)

Next on the implementation list is [IronMQ](http://dev.iron.io/mq/).

## HornetQ Backend

To send and receive messages with HornetQ:

````
user> (require '[bureaucrat.endpoint :as endpoint])
nil
user> (require '[bureaucrat.endpoints.hornetq :as hornetq])
nil
user> (def queue (hornetq/start-hornetq-endpoint! "an-example-endpoint"))
#'user/queue
user> (endpoint/send! queue "Hello, world!")
#<HornetQTextMessage HornetQMessage[ID:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6]:PERSISTENT>
user> (endpoint/receive! queue)
"Hello, world!"
 ````
 
`receive!` will block forever if not given a timeout. This is mainly
useful for testing. Real systems tend to use the version with a
timeout, which returns `nil` if no message has become available for
receipt in timeout milliseconds, or better yet the asynchronous
listener.

For example, to use `receive!` with a timeout of one second:

````
user> (endpoint/receive! queue 1000)
nil
````
 
No message was sent during the 1 second window, so `receive!` returned
nil.

### Asynchronous receipt

To receive messages asynchronously, we can register a handler function
on the queue. When a message becomes available, the handler will be
invoked in a background thread with the message as its sole argument.

````
user> (endpoint/register-listener! queue (fn [x] (println "Handler got a message:" x)) 1)
#<MessageProcessorGroup org.immutant.messaging.MessageProcessorGroup@12345678>
user> (endpoint/send! queue "Hello, world!")
Handler got a message: Hello, world!
#<HornetQTextMessage HornetQMessage[ID:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6]:PERSISTENT>
````

### Utility functions

You can count the messages currently in a queue, and unconditionally
purge all messages in the queue.

````
user> (endpoint/count-messages queue)
1
user> (endpoint/purge! queue)
1
user> (endpoint/count-messages queue)
0
````

## Component / Lifecycle Architecture

Bureaucrat's backend message queue adapters are implemented as
components within Stuart Sierra's
["Component"](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component) software
component lifecycle management framework. The use of this framework in
your code is entirely optional; Bureaucrat will work fine without it.

Each Bureaucrat component provides a constructor that returns an uninitialized
component as well as a convenience method that returns an initialized
component. The uninitialized version is to be used with the Component
lifecycle management library; Component will start and stop it
automatically. The initialized version returned by the convenience
method can be used directly in cases where Component is not in use.

For example, `bureaucrat.endpoints.hornetq/hornetq-endpoint` returns a
record that has not yet been connected to the HornetQ backend. This
can be incorporated into Component orchestrations directly, like any
other. If you are not using Component in your program, you should
instead use the convenience method
`bureaucrat.endpoints.hornetq/start-hornetq-endpoint!`, which creates
the HornetQ adapter component and also starts it for you (that is,
connects it to the HornetQ backend.)
